Experiment at https://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard

Create FPGA-based emulator (verilog?) if necessary

functions:
    control body
    interactions (social behavior)

can we apply research done on humans to these
    -timeless neuron firing
    -neurotrasmitters
    -neuronal development

information theory for deep learning <-> schmidhuber
" " ...                         " <-> testing in c elegans?
can we then find an 'optimal' network architecture?
Not morphic but graphic (not wire cost economics)
