# CElegans

1-week exploration project onto the deep end of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. Elegans). 

C. Elegans is the only organism to have it's connectome fully mapped and serves as a model organism for developmental biology and neuronal development. I became somewhat fascinated by the idea of biomimetics in machine learning, not as a tool for scalable networks, but for the creation of optimized robust networks. I wanted to examine the potential for analyzing the information (like in information theory) flow throughout the C. Elegans network after I read the paper "C. Elegans inspires self-driving cars" from *Nature*.


This repo are my semi-organized thoughts and research on this model organism, including its simulation and morphology.
