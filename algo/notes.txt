Questions:
    NCP inspired by C. Elegans
        Are they robust to adversarial examples (why or why not)
        Are they generalizable to larger networks
        What time overhead do we have because of the nonhomogeneity
        Is the architecture robust to changes (smooth adaptability space)
        Can we have competing results by some certain type of homogeneity of components
        Do we understand the implications of small networks (capacity, speed, etc)
        
        How does it relate to spike neurons in nets (related to binarized nets)
    
    Biological:

        What is the level of abstraction do we need (in the model) for decent behavior
controlling (apart from the phenomic dispositions)
        What classical/interesting experiments, e.g. visual similarity matrix done on mammals/humans and ai systems (haha no visual system), statistical measures of nets (after pruning?), etc, can be transferred to cele.
        Can we incorporate a visual system, or are the variables receiving (how) somehow the
        correct or sufficient representation of its environment for its goals?

Morphological structure
    A big part of the structure dates back to 1986 with 'The structure of the nervous
    system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans' that used electron micrographs to map it.

    It showed that it has 302 neurons with 118 classes (roughly) and have about
    5000 chemical synapses, 2000 neuromuscular (electrical impulse to activity for muscle fibers) junctions and 600 gap junctions.
    ?HOW
    
    'Structural Properties of the Caenorhabditis elegans Neuronal Network'
    Then expanded the wiring diagram with new data. This can be found (perhaps updated)
    here: 
    FILL

    This model is still not complete given that we have not information on gap junction
    rectification (diode), long range neuromodulation, etc.
    
    
    'Optimally wired subnetwork determines neuroanatomy of Caenorhabditis elegans' shows
    84% of the neurons are optimally wired with 5% position error.
    This variance is mostly explained by economical wiring cost.
    EXPAND

    However, several assumptions are made:
        -one axon -> many synapses becomes many synapses -> many axons
        CONTINUE

    Datasets:
    Midbody bend and speeds + segmentation ~5 TB of video data and numbers.


Behavior:
    Due to individual variability and, perhaps, missing data, the C. Elegans' functions
    can't be exactly mapped, however, with recordings (segmented), we can try to identity
    different behavioral patterns.
