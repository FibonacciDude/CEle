Compression

Look at technical, historical background

RL Relationships
    definition rl
    mathematical assumptions
    logical assumptions
    relationship with action - successes and drawbacks
    redefining the relationship to make compression, not action the star?

Current success
    is it so clear DRL systems are not somewhat following the principles?
        muzero, dqn, ...
            what is the nn doing?
        classic algos
            what is being learned?

        example:
            hierarchical language rnns - (paper)

Limits
    computational
    efficiency
    is it a stepping stone or the endgoal
    does it have to be bootstrapped, salvaged, or rewritten

What does it do (what is it?):    
    Common points
    Inductive definition
    Can we make this a prior
    history of priors
    similarity and difference between those


Consequence:
    How much better would it be to have 'compression' systems (fix)
    

Challenges
    How do we specify goals
