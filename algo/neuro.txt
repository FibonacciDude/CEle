Synapses
Chemical synapses - connections that share neurotransmitters
gap junctions - bidirectional electrical impulses that are faster than chemical synapses
    (in cold blooded brains for instance)
but lack gain (amplify signal)
Gap junctions (electrical synapses connected by connexons) are much simpler than their
chemical counterpart due to their lack of neurotransmitters.

Dendritic computation has many flavors
If together -> sublinear summation by shunning
else -> linear summation
Smoothing, amplification (by addition), and lowering (gap junction, attenuation) of the signal

Confusing(?):
Dendrites coming out are apical
Dendrites coming in are basal

temporal summation - makes signal algebraically bigger
spatial summation - adds all signals (sub or par linear)

Signals also backpropagate, which *may* (still disputed) serve as dendrodentritic
inhibition, depolarization, ...

Cells also move towards current - electrotaxis/galvanotaxis

Frequently in biology, experiments have multiple hypothesis. Thus, q-values (proportion of type I errors in m tests) are used instead of p (to show significance).
