add stuff to this repo from notes (and pics)
complete part of notes
analysis of circuits - http://wormweb.org/gapfree/
find properties of network (graph)
adjancency matrix

how the hell is the science (criticality, synaptic weights, etc) is joined together?
are they for the same thing??? (dynamics?)

information theory for net and for SIE (https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/nn826)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00810
Opening the Black Box of Deep Neural Networks via Information
variational autoencoders ( to see techniques to extend)

understand information theory and be comfortable with it

can we connect that to linear controllers?

simple baselines - tictac, etc

learning class
machines learn hints - mapping of words to constraints? (specific case?)
PCA learning

compr - can we have variable sized? (look at capsule nets)
language and representation (meaning) - compression 
bob coacke, george lakoff

simplify many ideas (cause or symptom?) - 
attetion is all you need
mathematica analysis

human robot interaction
